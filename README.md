Statistical Machine Learning Team Project 1
A training dataset of 24 Million true edges of a social network graph were given and test dataset with 1000 real and fake edges. Our task was to predict if each of those test edges are really edges in the Twitter network or are fake ones, and the challange was that there were no fake training examples.
